# DSBViewer


This program will take the HIRS data from <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump">Satdump</a> and create a gif from the layers.


The program is clunky right now, first changing all the images to jpg, then sequentially adding each image to the gif.

 Is it amateur? Yes


Expected Output:
