# DSBViewer


This program will take the HIRS data from <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump">Satdump</a> and create a gif from the layers.


The program is clunky right now, first changing all the images to jpg, then sequentially adding each image to the gif.

### Is it amateur? Yes

## Expected Output:

<img src="C:\Users\angry\OneDrive\Documents\prgrms\pythonprojects\DSBviewer\Atmosphere_Layers" width="56" height="72>
